This kind of repository is the one that groups every lesson learned on various life situations. Here I decided to share the knowledge on programming languages earned on web-courses, presencial-courses, university and all other systems. There are basic topics so there are advanced ones whose goal is simply to show and share wisdom.

- ![#F6BC0A](https://placehold.it/15/F6BC0A/000000?text=+) `Python`
  - My favourite one! I think Python changed my life in a very special way. With this language, I discovered a lot of new things involving Data Science, Machine Learning and even design of dashboards (thanks to libs like matplotlib and seaborn). Here we have a compiled of lessons learned on youtube, ufabc, internet and courses.
  
- ![#D5082D](https://placehold.it/15/D5082D/000000?text=+) `SQL`
  - Structure Query Language is my state of art on learning. Recently, I just engaged and some good courses on edX and Coursera to exceed the basic level and to know specific details of SQL. I must admit that it's has been a really good experience and it has helped me a lot in some situations.
  
- ![#2508D5](https://placehold.it/15/2508D5/000000?text=+) `C`
  - The things I learned on C helped me specially at UFABC. My course takes the demand for some IoT applications and C is really good on that. I used it on Arduino and other boards like NodeMCU. The truth is that C is very powerful on Artificial Inteligence and this could help me in the future.
  
- ![#F62E0A](https://placehold.it/15/F62E0A/000000?text=+) `Java`
  - I live a relationship of love and hate with Java. Again, I used Java specially at UFABC for classes like Object Oriented Programming and Web Programming.
  
- ![#0883D5](https://placehold.it/15/0883D5/000000?text=+) `SAS`
  - I learned SAS for a job demmand and I really like the language can do. I took some courses from a Coursera specialization and put here everything I learned on that.
  
- ![#EA8607](https://placehold.it/15/EA8607/000000?text=+) `HTML`
  - In my life I've been facing some HTML challenges. One of them was originated on a class from UFABC where the students must create a website to put the progress on the labs. So here we have from HTML folder.
