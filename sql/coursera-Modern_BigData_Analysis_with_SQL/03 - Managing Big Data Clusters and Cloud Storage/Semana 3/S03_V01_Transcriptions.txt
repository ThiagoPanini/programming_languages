Every column in a table
has a data type. When you create a table
with Hive or Impala, you specify those data types along with the names
of the columns. In this lesson,
you'll learn about the data types that Hive
and Impala support. These break down into three main categories:
integer data types, which represent whole numbers, decimal data types, which can represent numbers with
fractional parts, and character string data types
which represent text. Hive and Impala also support some various
other data types that do not fall into
these three categories. You'll learn about those as well. You should already have a basic working understanding of some of these data types
because we've used some of them like string and int in creating table statements
earlier in this course. In this lesson, you'll learn the specific details of
these and other data types, and what limitations they have.
