Welcome to week three of managing big data in
clusters and cloud storage. In this week of the course, you'll learn about
data types and file type. At this point you already have some knowledge
of data types. Remember that every column in a table has a specific data type. You've used a few data
types already like strings and int in create table statements
earlier in the course. In this week of the course, we'll describe more details
about these and about the other data types that you can use with Hive and Impala. You'll learn about the limits of the different data types, what they're intended for, and how to choose the right ones
when you create a table. Then in the second half
of this week, you'll learn about file types. These are the different
file formats that you can use to store the data in
Hive and Impala tables. You've already
learned a little bit about file formats and you've seen some examples of files
in delimited text format. So in this week, we'll quickly cover and review
the text file format and then go into
more detail about three other popular file formats, Avro, Hark, and NRC. You'll learn what's different
about these file formats, when you choose one of them
versus text files and how to efficiently create tables with files in different formats. We'll also give a quick review of some other file formats
that are less often used.
