When you work with
large-scale data, you'll often come
across the problem of queries that take too
long to complete. While they're running,
these queries might use an enormous amount of the shared compute resources
on your cluster. Part of the issue is just the
sheer size of the data-set, but the specifics of a particular query and
the different stages that the SQL engine must
go through to provide the results can have a significant effect
on query performance. In this lesson, you'll learn a few general strategies for
improving query performance, darting with choosing
which query engine to use. You'll also see how to view the execution plan for
processing a query to see where the problem areas might be and you'll learn a few common ways to
address these problems. Then in the next two lessons
after this one, you'll learn about some more specific strategies for improving query performance in
two particular types of cases.
