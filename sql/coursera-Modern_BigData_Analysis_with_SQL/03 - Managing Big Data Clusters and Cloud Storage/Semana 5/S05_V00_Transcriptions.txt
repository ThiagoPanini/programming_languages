Welcome to week 5 of managing Big Data in clusters
and Cloud storage. All the lessons in this week of the course are Honors lessons. They're all optional, so you can complete the course
without taking them. But we believe these lessons
are valuable to anyone working with Hive or Impala in a real-world setting. In the real-world,
when you're managing large-scale data in clusters
in the Cloud storage, you'll sometimes encounter
problems and inefficiencies. For example, your queries
might take too long, or it might be that
specific types of queries, like joins or filtering queries, take an unexpectedly
long time to finish. Or your queries might be
too complicated to write, taking up too much time and reducing
analysts productivity. Or the process that
you use to load data into tables might
take too long to finish, or it might be
overly complicated. Perhaps it's difficult for
you or your colleagues to understand how exactly the data is flowing into Hive
and Impala tables, and what other systems the data
is flowing to and from. You might find that
the whole process fails to meet some of
the needs of your business. The good news is that
Hive and Impala offer a variety of solutions that can help you address these problems. In this week's lessons, we'll give you an overview
of some common ones.
