Anyone who has written
SQL queries for real-world applications
should be familiar with how lengthy and complex
these queries can be. For example, the query shown here combines data from
the flights, airlines, and planes tables to show
information about the kinds of aircraft flying into or out
of a particular airport. This query is not even really that long
by many standards, but still working
with queries like this, can become cumbersome. With the example here, it could be that you need to repeatedly enter the same query, substituting only the origin and dest values in the where clause. Using views can help
you to simplify complex queries especially ones that you need to run repeatedly. A view is like a saved query which can be used as if
it were a table itself. You can hide the complex part of the query in the
definition of the view, allowing you to run a simpler query against
that view each time. Views can be useful not only for convenience but
also for security. For example, if a table
contains sensitive information, you can restrict access to the table and create a view that exposes only the rows and columns of the table
that are not sensitive. In this lesson, you'll learn how to create, query, modify, and remove views, and
you'll learn about the limitations of views
in Hive and Impala.
