In the previous few lessons, you learned how to create
databases and tables. But what if you make
a mistake when doing this? For example, what if you
realize after creating a table, that you created it in
the wrong database, or that one of
the columns needs to be renamed or needs to have
a different data type? Or what if at a later date, you need to add new columns
to an existing table, or perhaps completely
drop an existing table? These are just a few examples of cases when you'll need to modify or remove
a database or table. In this lesson, you'll learn how, using alter and drop statements. In fact, you've already seen some incidental examples of
alter and drop statements, in some of the earlier lessons
in this course. In this lesson, we'll introduce
these statements more systematically and describe all the implications
of using them. For example, what happens to a table's data files when
you drop that table? What changes must you make to the data files if you add
a new column to a table? Often, before you modify a table, you want to examine it to see its existing schema
and other properties. So in this lesson, we'll also review how to do that using the
describe statement. We'll introduce a variation
on the described statement, and we'll introduce
another statement that's useful for seeing how
a table was created.
