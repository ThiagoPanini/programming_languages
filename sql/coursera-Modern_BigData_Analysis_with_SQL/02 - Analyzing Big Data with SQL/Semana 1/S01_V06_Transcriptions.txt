In all the required lessons
in this course, you can use Q as the SQL
interface to Hive and Impala. But if you're working
as a data analyst in the real world, there are times
when you'll need or want to instead use
a command-line interface, or CLI to run SQL queries. For example, you might only have command-line access to a cluster
running Hive or Impala, or you might need to incorporate some Hive or Impala queries into a process that's implemented
using command-line tools. In cases like these, you can use two specialized
command-line interfaces, also known as shells
for Hive and Impala. In this video, I'll give a brief overview of
these two shells. Then in the next two videos, you'll learn how to use them. Beeline is the command-line
interface for Hive. Beeline is based on an open source utility
called SQL line. It uses JDBC to connect to Hive. You can use it interactively where you start up
the Beeline shell, and then enter and run
SQL statements in it, or you can use it as
a batch tool to run a single SQL statement or
a set of SQL statements, and then exit when it's finished. Impala shell is the command-line
interface for Impala. Impala shell actually doesn't use ODBC or JDBC to
connect to Impala. It uses a different interface
called Apache Thrift, but you don't need to know or
understand that to use it. Like Beeline, it can
be used interactively, or it can run one or more
statements then exit. These two utilities, Beeline and Impala shell have
similar functionality and they are comparable to
the command line utilities that are available
for interacting with traditional relational
database systems like MySQL. But these two utilities
differ in some notable ways, and there are
some specific details you need to know to use them.
