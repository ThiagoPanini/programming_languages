In a typical join, the join conditions are expressed as one or more
equality conditions. This is called an equijoin. A non-equijoin is
a join that uses some other comparison
instead of equality. In a non-equijoin, you can use comparisons such as not equal, less than, or greater than
in the join conditions. Here's an example:
The employees table lists the salary
for each employee, and the salary_grades table lists the salary grades or levels and their associated minimum
and maximum salaries. To find the salary grade
for each employee, you could use a non-equijoin with inequality comparisons
for the join conditions. For instance, in
the results you can see Ambrosia Rojas has
salary grade 2, because his salary, which is 25,784, is greater than or equal
to the minimum salary for grade 2, which is 20,000,
and less than or equal to the maximum salary for
grade 2, which is 29,999. Impala, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and some other SQL engines support non-equijoin queries
like this one. But with Hive, only equality conditions
are allowed in joins.
