In the previous weeks of this course,
you learned how to use the clauses of the SELECT statement to
query single tables. You learned how to use different
combinations of these clauses to answer different kinds of questions. But in all the queries you saw so
far in this course, each FROM clause referred
to just one table, and each result set contained
data from just one table. In this final week of the course, you'll
learn how to use the SELECT statement to combine data from two or
more tables into a single result set. Conceptually, there are two
ways you can do this. You can combine data vertically, rowwise,
stacking data on top of other data. Or you can combine data horizontally,
columnwise, merging data side by side. In SQL, there are two different words for these two different
ways of combining data. Vertically: that's a union. And horizontally: that's a join. So that's the high level
conceptual way to understand it. You'll see in the upcoming videos that
there are a couple different types of unions and
several different types of joins. And there are some important details
that you'll need to understand. The good news is that doing union and join operations in SQL does not
require learning any new statements. Both of these are performed using
the familiar SELECT statement, and there's only a little bit of
new syntax you'll need to learn to perform them.
