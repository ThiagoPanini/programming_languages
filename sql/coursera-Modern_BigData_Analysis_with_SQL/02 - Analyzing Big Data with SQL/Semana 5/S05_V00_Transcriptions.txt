Welcome to week 5 of
analyzing big data with SQL. So far in this course, you have learned about five of the clauses
that you can use in a select statement. The SELECT clause, which specifies what columns should
be returned to your query result. The FROM clause, which specifies where
the data you're querying should come from. The WHERE clause, which filters the individual rows
of data based on some conditions. The GROUP BY clause,
which splits data into groups. And the related topic of aggregation, which reduces each group
down to a single value. And the HAVING clause, which filters
the data based on aggregates. In this week of the course, you'll learn about two more clauses,
ORDER BY and LIMIT. These clauses enable you to
control the arrangement and number of the rows in a result set. These two clauses, ORDER BY and LIMIT, are the final two clauses you
will learn about in this course. So at the end of this week, you'll
know all of the basic techniques for querying data from single tables. Then looking ahead in week six
of the course the final week, you'll learn how to use SELECT statements
to combine data from multiple tables.
