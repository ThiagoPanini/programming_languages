Aggregation is the act of taking multiple values and reducing
them down to a single value. Two of the simplest forms
of aggregation, are counting and adding. Everyone understands these
but just for completeness, I'll show an example of each
using the employees table. Counting, simply
means tallying up the roads figuring out
how many rows there are. It's easy to see that
this table has five rows. You do not need to look at any of the values in the rows
to count them. Adding or summing is
also very simple but it does require you to look
at the values in the rows. For example, to compute the sum or total of
all the salary values, you add up all the values
in the salary column. The sum of these is $185,403. The result of an aggregation
is called an aggregate. So in these examples
5 and 185,403 are both aggregates counting and adding are not the only forms
of aggregation. Here are a few others. Computing the average of
the values in a column. The average is the sum of all the values divided
by the number of values. In this example the average
salary is $37,080.60. Finding the minimum
value in a Column. The minimum salary is $25,784. Finding the maximum
value in a column. The maximum salary is $54,523. All of these are
types of aggregation. In the next video
you'll learn about the built-in functions in SQL
for computing all of these.
