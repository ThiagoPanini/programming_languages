Welcome to Week 3 of
Analyzing Big Data with SQL. In the previous week's lessons, you learned about two of the clauses
that make up a select state. The SELECT clause, which specifies what column should
be returned in your result set, and the FROM clause, which specifies where
the data you're querying should come from. The SELECT clause is a required
part of every SELECT statement, and the FROM clause is required to query
actual rows of data from tables. In this week of the course and
throughout the remaining weeks, you'll learn about several more
clauses that are not required but that enable you to answer
different types of questions. This week is all about the WHERE clause, which filters the rows of data
based on some specified conditions. Even though we’re moving on
to a new clause this week, you’ll see that we will revisit many of
the topics covered in the previous week, including data types, expressions,
operators, and functions. These are just important in the WHERE
clause as they are in the SELECT clause. And in this week of the course,
I'll extend to some of those topics. You'll learn about Boolean data types,
how to write Boolean expressions, how to use logical operators and
conditional function. Understanding each of these topics will
help you specify the conditions to control which rows of data
are returned in a result set.
