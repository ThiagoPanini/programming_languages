Welcome to Week 4 of
Analyzing Big Data with SQL. So far in this course, you have learned about three of the clauses that you can
use in a Select statement. The Select clause,
which specifies what columns should be
returned in your query result. The From clause, which specifies where the data you're
querying should come from. The Where clause, which filters the rows of data
based on some conditions. In this week of the course, you'll learn about two
more Select clauses. Group BY, and Having. These clauses enable
you to answer questions about
aggregates of the data. But before you learn how
to use these clauses, you need to understand
what aggregation is. So I'll begin with a brief
introduction to this concept. Then I'll describe
some common forms of aggregation and show how you can compute each one using a built-in function in SQL. You'll see that the syntax
for using these functions, is mostly the same as for the built-in functions
you learned about in previous weeks, but the way they work and what
they return is different. We'll also return this week to the topic of missing values, and you'll see how SQL engines handle those in aggregations. When you're working
with large scale data, grouping and aggregation are indispensable because
they allow you to summarize
all the rows in a table, with a result set that
has just a few rows. So at the end of this week, you'll have the skills
necessary to produce succinct summaries of
enormous data sets.
