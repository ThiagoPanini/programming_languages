In this course and throughout
this specialization, you'll find the optional
honors track as a focus on one concrete goal. Preparing you to become a Cloudera certified
associate data analyst. Their certification is
a separate credential from the ones you
receive from Coursera. It is a professional
certification and meant to verify your ability as
a data analyst of big data. We cannot guarantee that if you go through this
Coursera training, you will pass the
Cloudera certification. Of course, we can't
guarantee that. But we will help you to develop the variabilities that
the exam is designed to test. We'll give you practice with these skills you'll
need to demonstrate, and familiarity with
the resources you'll use both in the exam and in
your professional work. The rest is up to you. We have designed
this specialization and the certification with the same ultimate goal
to help you build proven mastery of data analysis
in the big data world, and to help organizations
of all sorts to find people such as
yourself for this work. For this week, I'm assigning
you the task to read Cloudera's webpage on
the certification program. Because that contains
the core information you need to enroll and
take the examination. I'll test you on that page
because I want you to be secure in knowing how you will go about the
certification process.
