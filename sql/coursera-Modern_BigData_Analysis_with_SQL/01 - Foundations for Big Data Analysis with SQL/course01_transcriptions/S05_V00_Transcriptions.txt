I hope you feel you've
benefited from the work on database concepts you've
done in this course. As long as you work
in the areas of Databases and Data Analysis, you'll find these concepts
and terminology useful, even as new technologies arise and overcome
limitations present today. This week, my focus is on the two technologies you will use hands-on throughout the rest
of this specialization. Apache Hive and Apache Impala. These tools have been in widespread production use
for a few years now enabling SQL approaches
to analytic work in big data. I'll talk a little bit about their background
and design concepts especially how they fit
onto big data stores. But I expect you're more than ready for some hands on activity. This week you'll
install and begin to use the Hands-on Environment. You'll interact with
data using Hue, a web-based interface to
Hive Impala and all your data. You'll begin to explore
new datasets in just the way you would do
on any new job or project and you'll finish by
creating a report of the sort you should find useful in any new
data environment
