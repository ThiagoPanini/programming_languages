SQL, Big Data, Big Data, SQL. It's not a perfect fit as
much as we'd like it to be. Relational databases
don't just pick up and move over to
encompass Big Data. As you'll see this week, some approaches avoid
the SQL question altogether and use very different types of systems for
Big Data applications. You'll see that the term NoSQL has two different
interpretations, and both interpretations
are useful. But for data analysts, the appeal of SQL remains, and is so useful and popular that it's
nearly Irresistible. You'll see how some technologies
adapt SQL to Big Data, and how these systems
handle metadata differently than traditional
relational systems do. You'll also consider
the growing options for storing Big Data. In your own company data
centers, in Cloud storage, or a combination of the two, and you'll see why
you might choose one option over the others.
