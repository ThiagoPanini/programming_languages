Imagine that you're
a contestant on a game show. I'll show you a series
of four doors, and you can choose any one door to claim
the prize behind it. I'll even tell you in
advance: behind door number 1 is a 1000 ten-dollar bills; behind door number 2
is a million one-dollar bills; behind door number 3
is a billion dimes - - that's tenths of a dollar; and behind door number 4
is a trillion pennies - - hundredths of a dollar. Which door do you choose? If you choose door number 4, you'll get the highest
dollar figure for your choice - but you'll have
to manage a trillion pennies. Working with big data is
like choosing the pennies: you have the opportunity
to store vastly larger amounts of data, even data with
lower value per item, but with a higher reward
from your data overall. This week I'll cover the main characteristics
of big data stores today. You'll learn the "three
V's" of big data, and you'll begin to
appreciate the differences between big data and
relational databases.
