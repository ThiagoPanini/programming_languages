Do you think relational
databases get that name because they
contain related tables? No! Would you guess that a "denormalized table" is called
that because it's unusual? No! Do you think acid always refers to a corrosive or
a sour liquid like lemon juice? No. This week, I'll give
you the concepts and special vocabulary
that are common to all users of SQL and
relational databases. You'll learn about the
fundamentals of database design, and what primary keys, foreign keys, and
database triggers are. These concepts are essential
to your being fluent in the different uses of SQL
on data, big and small. If you already know SQL, you'll get through
this week very quickly, but maybe, you'll
find the material interesting, and maybe I'll
fill in a few gaps for you. And, I hope you'll go to
the discussion boards and help round out the concepts I present for
your fellow learners.
