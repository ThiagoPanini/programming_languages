In this lesson, I will survey a variety of
database systems in the big data world. You are not likely to touch all these
systems, at least not right away. Nevertheless, I want you to have at
least an acquaintance with them, so that you will know where they
stand next to the tools you will use, as a big data analyst. Then over the course of this week, I'll bring focus on to the two principle
tools you will use in the hands on work. Apache Impala and Apache Hive. Traditional relational databases, continue
to be extremely useful and popular. However, with the explosion in volume and
variety of big data, it became evident that these
traditional systems do not serve all database needs with the best cost and
performance. Alternative systems have grown
in popularity in the modern era, the era of the world wide web. Among the most successful
big data systems, are big analytic systems or
data warehouses. These includes Apache Impala, Apache Hive, Apache Drill and Presto. You will become skilled with Hive and Impala in the subsequent
courses of this specialization. Hive and Impala each implement
their own dialects of SQL. Hive QL for Hive, and
Impala SQL for Impala. These dialects are similar to one another, and their uses in analytic
systems emphasize a subset of SQL most suitable for data warehouses. Other large analytic database systems
include Oracle data warehousing and Teradata. But these systems tend to have
a much higher cost per terabyte of data than the others.
