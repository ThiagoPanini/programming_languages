If you're watching this video, then I assume you've read the web-page about Cloudera
certification process, and you've verified
your understanding of the web-page by taking our quiz. I'm glad you're interested
in Cloudera certification. The honors track in the rest
of this specialization, will give you
the extra practice with the tools and experience
with the documentation, so that you'll be largely
self-sufficient and well-qualified to work
as a big data analyst. I hope you'll then go on
to take and pass the exam, and I look forward to
seeing you on the roles of Cloudera certified
associate data analysts.
